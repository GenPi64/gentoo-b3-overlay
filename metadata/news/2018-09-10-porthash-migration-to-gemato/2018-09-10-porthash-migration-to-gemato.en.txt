Introduction
------------

If you are subscribed to the rsync mirror at
rsync://isshoni.org/gentoo-portage-b3, and using the automatic signed
hash checking provided by app-portage/b3-check-porthash, please note
that I am no longer publishing repo.hash and repo.hash.asc signature
files for this mirror.

This is because Gentoo itself now contains a signed repository checker
(gemato), used automatically by sys-apps/portage (with rsync-verify USE
flag). Further, with >=portage-2.3.42, repos that do not pass the gemato
check (against official Gentoo public keys) are quarantined.

As such, there is no further need for my privately generated signed
hashes (and indeed from gemato's POV they pollute the tree), so I am
withdrawing them.

Action Required
---------------

To prevent your genup runs failing in future, issue the following
commands, in order, on your B3, as root:

b3 ~ # emaint sync --repo gentoo-b3
b3 ~ # emerge --oneshot --verbose sys-apps/portage
b3 ~ # emerge --depclean app-portage/b3-check-porthash

The first ensures you have the rsync-verify USE flag, and ~arm
accept_keywords set for sys-apps/portage. The second updates Portage
itself (to a signature-checking variant). The third removes the
/etc/portage/repo.postsync.d hook that runs porthash automatically.

At your option, you may then also remove app-portage/porthash itself.

Best, sakaki <sakaki@deciban.com>
